//Sample Run Output
The length of "Yonas" is 5
The length of "" is 0
The length of nullptr is 0
s1 is "" and its length is 0
s2 is "Y" and its length is 1
s3 is "CMPT 135" and its length is 8
s4 is "CMPT 135" and its length is 8
s4 is "" and its length is 0
s4 is "Y" and its length is 1
s4 is "A" and its length is 1
s4 is "This is cool" and its length is 12
s4[2] is i
s4[2] is a
s4 is "That is cool" and its length is 12
s1 is "That is cool" and its length is 12
s3 is "CMPT 135 " and its length is 9
s3 is "CMPT 135 201901" and its length is 15
The first index of '1' in "CMPT 135 201901" is 5
The first index of 'm' in "CMPT 135 201901" is -1
The last index of '1' in "CMPT 135 201901" is 14
The last index of 'm' in "CMPT 135 201901" is -1
'1' appears 0 times in "That is cool"
s1 is "019" and its length is 3
s1 is "01901" and its length is 5
s1 is "01901" and its length is 5
"01901" is a substring of "CMPT 135 201901"
"01901" is not a substring of "01902029010190"
"01901" is a substring of "01902019010190"
s1 is "01901" and its length is 5
The reverse of "01901" is "10910"
After removing all the '1' characters from "01901", we get "090"
After removing all the '1' characters from "11111111111", we get ""
After replacing 1 by 5 from "01902029010190", we get 05902029050590
s1 is "090", s3 is "" and s1 + s3 is "090"
s1 is "090 and s1 + "yonas" is "090yonas
s1 is "090 and s1 + 'Y' is "090Y
s1 is "090", s2 is "Test", and s3 is ""
After s3 = s1 += s2, we get s1 is 090Test, s2 is Test, and s3 is 090Test
s2 is "Test". After s2 += "FIC", we get "TestFIC"
s2 is "TestFIC". After s2 += '!', we get "TestFIC!"
s1 is "Test1", s2 is "" and s1 == s2 is 0
